When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
If your project involves other contributors, it might be easier to have everybody access it at a site like GitHub, rather than passing URLs back and forth among everybody and wondering who is up to date.  Or even with just one contributor, it could be nice to have a remote site to keep the most up-to-date working version of a project for the public to see, while simultaneously working on changes in a local repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
You might want to finish developing an idea locally from a given point of the remote master, without integrating whatever changes have since been made to the remote.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks are repositories that stay within the remote location. Clones move to or stay in the local area.  Branches happen within one repository.  Forks can be used for taking a project in a new direction without changing the original project, or for developing the project in a parallel way, perhaps to be combined with the original project later.  Clones are used to work on a project in your local repository. Branches are used when the repository already exists locally and the user wants to explore in a different direction from the master thread, committing to the new branch without affecting the master until merging.
